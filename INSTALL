McBasic Auth Generator

After running the generator you should have at least the user, user_session models and user_session controller.
To make it handy you can add the following routes to your routes.rb file :

# Rails 2.3.*
	map.login "login", :controller => "user_sessions", :action => "new"
	map.logout "logout", :controller => "user_sessions", :action => "destroy"
	map.signup "signup", :controller => "users", :action => "new"

# Rails 3
	match "/logout" => 'user_sessions#destroy', :as => "logout"
	match "/login" => 'user_sessions#new', :as => "login"
	match "/signup" => 'users#new', :as => "signup"

You also probably want to add the following methods to your App Controller :

def current_user_session
	return @current_user_session if defined?(@current_user_session)
	@current_user_session = UserSession.find
end

def current_user
	return @current_user if defined?(@current_user)
	@current_user = current_user_session && current_user_session.record
end

You should then run a rake db:migrate.
